# Genshin-Switcher-Sh
Allow multiple versions of Genshin Impact to share game data packages on Android devices to save storage space.

# How to use?
Run this script in a terminal that can access `Android/data` and follow the instructions. **You may need root permissions.** For example, it can be executed with root permissions in MT Manager.
# How does it work?
In simple terms, it helps users keep only one copy of the original game data package and save the files unique to different versions. When using this script to switch, unnecessary duplicate files will be automatically deleted.
# Known issue(s)
After switching, the game may prompt "Not enough storage space to install required resources." when starting up. Please manually modify the file ownership information according to the GIF below.
